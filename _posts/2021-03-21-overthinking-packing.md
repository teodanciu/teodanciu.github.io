title: Overthinking Packing

<br/><br/>
The problem of packing your things to move house has an interesting shape: you are grouping things together so that they can be taken apart later. 

What are the tradeoffs to think about when choosing how to group or nest stuff?


One of them is the **access pattern**:  how often do you need easy access to particular things before unpacking? This might not be relevant in all circumstances,  but it was in my case: I moved most things to a storage space and myself to a temporary home (a "stopover") with what I need to survive for a month - before moving everything to the final destination.
So I established  three categories:
 * _storage_: trade easy access for space
 * _stopover_: I aimed to keep this as small as possible,  so as to not impose on my host's generosity, but not smaller  - for the same reason
 * _packing_:  since it took me days to finish and wanted to live in relatively normal conditions while doing so <br/>

The stopover category was the most difficult  - it was tempting to think that what I need in the next month is what I needed in the previous month - so the most recently and frequently used things. However, in a different home, life will most likely have a different shape, with different needs. The weather might also change. Making this category larger can make up for some of the nondeterminism, at the cost of some inconvenience (or guilty conscience).

**Size** is another consideration. Let's refer to a group of things packed together into some container as a _chunk_ - for want of a better word. <br/>The size of the containers  is an obvious limitation on the size of the chunks, but it's not the only one - since size impacts weight:
* "scaling up" a chunk by making it as big as the container permits is constrained by how much you can carry, whereas
* "scaling out" into several smaller ones is constrained by how many trips you can make to carry them. This can be parallelized, but splitting too much also loses cohesion and retrievability, which matter in some cases.
In my particular case, I faced the size problem when packing books: distributing them over several large and very solid bags, when one or two of them could contain them all. 

**Shape** of the chunks matters because it impacts the size of the total load that you need to move or store.<br/>
Stackable chunks help create a compact unit but at the same time they are likely inflexible, so can't occupy arbitrary spaces as well as amorphous objects can. <br/>
Having mostly stackable chunks and a few "free-form" ones seems like a good compromise. 
Stackable containers however might come at a cost: they can be heavy, if the material is solid, or difficult to carry. <br/>
The compromise I found was to use light fabric boxes, that have take a basic rectangular structure but also take  the shape of whatever they contain. Since I usually store many things in small containers "at rest", packing became a matter of combining these smaller containers into the fabric boxes in a way that creates a stackable chunk. The structure of the nested containers determined the shape of the outer one. 

If unpacking is not immediate, then the **"semantics"** of things becomes important - since you want to be able to locate particular items easily. 
Building cohesive chunks, containing things that belong together is an obvious way to achieve this, but it is an elusive task. <br/> I found it to be a good instance of the Pareto-principle: you can probably group 80% of things in 20% of time, while the "miscellaneous", or things that can belong to several categories can take  the painful 80% of time or mental energy. <br/>
In my case, I favored the size/shape over semantic precision. <br/>
Having smaller containers within the bigger ones mitigated the inconvenience to some degree:  it is easier to make the smaller containers cohesive. <br/> 
Indexing the content of the chunks or building an "inverted index"  (mapping objects to the containing chunk) can make up for  the mini-chaos created by grouping unrelated things.

<br/>
<br/>
In the end, packing - although it is putting things together in order to take them apart, is still a matter of **decomposing a problem** (all your stuff) into smaller ones and **composing the solutions to achieve a goal** (moving, storing or unpacking). The choices you are making when decomposition and grouping have an impact on what kind of problems the final solution will create. <br/>

It is unclear whether thinking about all this has improved my "solution", but it certainly kept me from drowning in boredom and fatigue while packing.
